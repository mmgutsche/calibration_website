            <h2>How to become better at judging your own uncertainty</h2>
            <p><strong>Why Calibration Matters:</strong> Inspired by the insights from "How to Measure Anything," this
                tool emphasizes the idea that with the right techniques, it is possible to measure almost anything, even
                perceptions of immeasurable. Through this app, you'll learn to quantify your uncertainties and make
                better-informed decisions.</p>
            <p><strong>How It Works:</strong> Practice estimating answers within a 90% confidence range, and refine your
                skills in assessing the probability and impact of various outcomes.</p>
            <p><strong>Further Learning:</strong> Discover more about effective measurement techniques and their
